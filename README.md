# Generating MNIST Handwritten Digits Using A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7aebc68a-bc74-4fd0-80ed-15f4a6eb2114

## Background:
Started learning about GANs a few days ago and managed to implement one that generates new MNIST handwritten digits with PyTorch. Created a normal GAN and modified it to a conditional one, allowing a user to specifiy what number they want to generate. Will clean up the README when I wake up cause it's currently 6 am and I wanna sleep.
